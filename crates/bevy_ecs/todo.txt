- pull back observer and hooks and fututre bevy will use them extensively. rename your Event to News or Action or Act.
  actually let everything remain same. We will use bevy Event as mine event too. As Event is just a marker anyway.
- bevy is going to allow disabling change detection for component. So there is no need to remove change detection from it right now. Do it if bevy doesn't do it.
